Knockout is tested on the following browsers:

 * Mozilla Firefox 2.0+ (latest version tested = 3.6.8)
 * Google Chrome (tested on version 5 for Windows and Mac; should work on older versions too)
 * Microsoft Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
 * Apple Safari (tested on Windows Safari version 5, Mac OS X Safari version 3.1.2, and iPhone Safari for iOS 4; should work on newer/older versions too)
 * Opera 10 for Windows

It's very likely that Knockout also works on older and newer versions of these browsers, but there's only so many combinations we can check regularly! At the time of the last check, Knockout was also found to work on the following browsers (though we don't recheck these for every release):

 * Opera Mini
 * Google Android OS browser (OS version 2.2)

To get a good idea of how Knockout will run on another browser or platform, simply navigate the browser to http://knockoutjs.com/spec/runner.html. This will validate more than 100 behavioral specifications and produce a report of any problems. The pass rate should be 100% on all the browsers listed above.
